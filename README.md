In recent years, artificial intelligence has been developing rapidly. Nowadays, it can be seen that the invention of the self-driving car or self-service supermarket has been introduced. Artificial
intelligence is closely linked to computer vision. Humans utilise vision to adapt and understand the environments they are surrounded with, whilst computer vision works on duplication of human
vision but electronically to perceive and interpret an image. Computer vision is not only working as an eye to see, but it needs to react. It needs to be empowered to detect, identify, and process the
images perceived like what human vision did. For example, when a person walks to the path of a driving car, the driver must react quickly and take action. From the view of the driver’s vision, his
brain undergoes three major steps: identifying, processing, and deciding. This is the aim of computer vision to perform the same operations efficiently. Face recognition is part of computer
vision. Face recognition is used to identifying a person in a biometric method based on the image on their face. A person is identified through biological traits. Human eyes can easily recognise
people by simply looking at them, but the concentration span for human eyes has its limit. Hence, a computerised method is invented to perform face recognition. Face recognition includes
automatically detecting, followed by verifying a person from either picture or video.

Nowadays, face recognition is being used in large organisations, especially the use of the HR department is immense as it plays a very important role in recognising employees and keep track
of their attendance. Employee attendance monitoring is a key function in every HR department. Without a time and attendance system in an organisation, it can be difficult for the HR department
to track and monitor the employees' attendance. Some organisations that are heavily dependent on human beings have a separate time office where individual employees' time is tracked. Employee
attendance monitoring system helps ensure that all employees and workers are fulfilling their obligations and duties. In any business organisation, most people that we hire are good workers
who respect the organisation’s schedule, but there are a few workers and employees who arrive late for the office and tend to leave early. An employee attendance monitoring system helps the HR department see who is clocked in and at what time. You can be sure that you only pay your
employees for the time they work. Employee attendance system gives an accurate picture of the organisation’s labour cost. It is a necessity of the HR department. Employee attendance monitoring
system allows you and your HR department to track employee time and attendance with precision.

The administrator can't monitor his staff during working hours all the time. He cannot act as dictator or babysitter, but it is very important to make sure that his employees come to the office on time
and take days off properly. He pays his employees for their talent and time, so if they are unproductive because they are sick or coming in late, his business will suffer. It is vital to keep
track of everyone in your company and their needs. The use of an employee attendance monitoring system can save the company’s time and reduce errors made while calculating attendance. Since
the application of computer vision is now everywhere, it will play a huge role in real-time face recognition and will perform better than the manual monitoring system. This is our key motto to
develop an effective face recognition model with the help of state-of-the-art computer vision lgorithms to monitor the entry and exti time of employees.
